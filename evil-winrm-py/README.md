# evil-winrm-py

`evil-winrm-py` is a python-based tool for executing commands on remote Windows machines using the WinRM (Windows Remote Management) protocol. It provides an interactive shell with enhanced features like file upload/download, command history, and colorized output. It supports various authentication methods including NTLM, Pass-the-Hash, Certificate, and Kerberos.

## Motivation

The original evil-winrm is written in Ruby, which can be a hurdle for some users. Rewriting it in Python makes it more accessible and easier to use, while also allowing us to leverage Python’s rich ecosystem for added features and flexibility.

I also wanted to learn more about winrm and its internals, so this project will also serve as a learning experience for me.

## Features

- Execute commands on remote Windows machines via an interactive shell.
- Support for NTLM authentication.
- Support for Pass-the-Hash authentication.
- Support for Certificate authentication.
- Support for Kerberos authentication with SPN (Service Principal Name) prefix and hostname options.
- Support for SSL to secure communication with the remote host.
- Support for custom WSMan URIs.
- Download files from the remote host to the local machine.
- Upload files from the local machine to the remote host.
- Auto-complete local and remote file paths with tab completion.
- Support for paths with spaces using quotes.
- Enable logging and debugging for better traceability.
- Navigate command history using up/down arrow keys.
- Display colorized output for improved readability..
- Lightweight and Python-based for ease of use.
- Keyboard Interrupt (Ctrl+C) support to terminate long-running commands gracefully.

Detailed documentation can be found in the [docs](./docs/) directory.

## Installation (Windows/Linux)

#### Installation of Kerberos prerequisites on Linux

```bash
sudo apt install gcc python3-dev libkrb5-dev krb5-pkinit
# Optional: krb5-user
```

### Install `evil-winrm-py`

> You may use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) instead of pip to install evil-winrm-py. `pipx`/`uv` is a tool to install and run Python applications in isolated environments, which helps prevent dependency conflicts by keeping the tool's dependencies separate from your system's Python packages.

```bash
pip install evil-winrm-py
pip install evil-winrm-py[kerberos] # for kerberos support on Linux
```

or if you want to install with latest commit from the main branch you can do so by cloning the repository and installing it with `pip`/`pipx`/`uv`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kraloveckey/mini-python
cd mini-python/evil-winrm-py
pip install .
```

### Update

```bash
pip install --upgrade evil-winrm-py
```

### Uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall evil-winrm-py
```
